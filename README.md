# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### In this project, I'm analyzing data based on plays and visual arts-related, with the purpose of creating a fundraising project for Louise, who is trying to launch a play called *Fever*. I organized, sorted, and analyzed the data, looking for details and factors to reach our goal with a successful campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### A Pivot Table was created to compare the successful, failed, and canceled projects; based on the month that they were launched. It's filtered by Theather, on the Parent Category section, but we can also compare the other categories with this complete Pivot Table. A better view of this data is expressed on the chart

### This table is divided into 12 different ranges, with over a thousand Theather plays analyzed, with the purpose of comparing their goals and their rate of achievement. In the chart, we can observe the comparison we did on the table

### It's extensive data to analyze. There are so many factors that can change the perspective and conclusion of this analysis. So, the challenge for me was to look at the right data to get the desired result.

## Results

- As we can see on the Chart

 Spring is very promising. The number of successful works is twice that of failed, in addition to other factors that may influence; but it is definitely the best season to launch the project. We observe that December is the month with the less volume, and where the successful numbers meet the failed ones.  

- The goal is one of the most important elements of the project. I determine that there are more possibilities of achievement with a reachable goal. The number of plays with a target under 5000$, tend to succeed more. 

- It's an old dataset (projects from 3-5 years ago). It's not organized and it has to be reviewed because there's data that can be taken off for better results

- We can compare the successful projects in different countries if it's desired. Also, we could see if there is a certain trend or inclinations on successful projects based on the backer count
